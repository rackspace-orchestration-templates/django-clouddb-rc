  Django is an open-source web application framework that allows Python
  developers to easily create dynamic websites.

  #### Overview
  The Python Virtual Environment under which Django will be installed will be
  located in the /srv directory. Permissions will be configured so that the
  Linux user that you specify (or pydev if you accepted the default value) will
  have ownership of the Virtual Environment directory. From there you will find
  a directory matching the name specified for your Django project. Your
  application will be installed in this directory if you chose to clone a git
  repository, otherwise it will be in the site-packages directory for the
  Virtual Environment if you chose to use a setuptools/distribute tarball. The
  tarball will be installed with pip, and all dependencies will be
  automatically installed. If you choose not to install a Django application at
  this time, the framework will be installed, but you will need to perform
  further development before your site will be accessible.

  #### Virtual Environment
  For development, log in with the system user that you created, and cd in to
  the directory for you virtual environment, which will be in the /srv
  directory. If you accept the default value the directory will be /srv/venv.
  From here you can activate your virtual environment by typing `bin/activate`.
  The Django project directory is inside the directory for the virtual
  environment and that's where you'll find the manage.py file for your Django
  project.

  #### Logging In via SSH
  The Linux user provided with this deployment will provide you SSH access to
  your servers. This user will have sudo access to gain root access.
  Alternatively, the private key provided in the passwords section can be used
  to login as root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with
  [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  Load Balanced Linux servers running [Django](http://djangoproject.com)
  installed in a [Python](http://python.org)
  [Virtual Environment](http://virutalenv.org)
  running behind [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) with
  [mod_wsgi](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/). The backend is a
  Cloud Database running [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/).
  You may install a Django application by providing a URL to a public git
  repository or a source distribution tarball that can be installed with pip.
  Alternatively, you can continue without installing an application at this
  time and your servers will be created with an empty Django project where
  you can begin development of your site.
